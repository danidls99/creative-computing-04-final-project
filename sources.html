                *Although I began this project with the intent of showcasing fun and lighthearted “witch tasks,” I would like to point out that the idea of healing, self care, and many of the other things I referenced in this project have very serious and real origins. It is important to know that Wicca is a real religion still practiced today. The concept of spiritual healing was created by black and brown femmes years and years ago. Please be mindful of these origins when viewing this project.
